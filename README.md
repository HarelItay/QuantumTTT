# 🌟 Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe 🌟

An interactive educational game that teaches quantum mechanics concepts through tic-tac-toe gameplay!

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Quantum Superposition**: Pieces exist as both X and O until observed
- **Probability Cards**: Choose from random probability distributions
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Click quantum pieces to determine their final state
- **Educational Content**: Learn real quantum mechanics principles while playing
- **Kid-Friendly Design**: Bright colors and intuitive interface for ages 8-12

## 🌀 How to Play

1. **Select a probability card** (e.g., "70% X, 30% O")
2. **Click an empty square** to place a quantum piece in superposition
3. **New cards appear automatically** after each placement
4. **Click any quantum piece** to collapse its wave function
5. **Win by getting 3 collapsed pieces** of the same type in a row!

## 🧠 Quantum Concepts Taught

- **Superposition**: Quantum pieces exist in multiple states simultaneously
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Observation forces a definite state
- **Probability**: Quantum outcomes are probabilistic, not deterministic
- **Measurement**: The act of observing changes the quantum system

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

This game is ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `quantum-tic-tac-toe`)
4. Make sure it's **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Check "Add a README file"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Upload these files from your local QTTT folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md` (this file)
3. Commit the files with a message like "Initial game upload"

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Access Your Game
- Your game will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
- It may take a few minutes to become available
- GitHub will show you the exact URL in the Pages settings
